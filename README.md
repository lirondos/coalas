# COALAS üê®
This repo contains the COrpus of AngLicisms in the SpAnish PresS (COALAS).

COALAS is a corpus of Spanish newswire annotated with unassimilated lexical borrowings. The corpus contains 370,000 tokens and includes various written media written in European Spanish. The test set was designed to be as difficult as possible: it covers sources and dates not seen in the training set, includes a high number of OOV words (92% of the borrowings in the test set are OOV) and is very borrowing-dense (20 borrowings per 1,000 tokens).

## Corpus splits
|Set      | Tokens | ENG  | OTHER |  Unique |
|:-------|-----:|-----:|---------:|---------:|
|Training |231,126 |1,493 | 28 |380 |
|Development |82,578 |306 |49 |316|
|Test |58,997 |1,239 |46 |987|
|**Total** |372,701 |3,038 |123 |1,683 |

## Annotation
The annotation considers two labels:  
* ``ENG``: For English lexical borrowings (*smartphone*, *online*, *podcast*)
* ``OTHER``: For lexical borrowings from any other language (*boutique*, *anime*, *umami*)

The model uses BIO encoding to account for multitoken borrowings.

## Models
There are two publicly-available models trained on this dataset for the task of automatic detection of anglicisms. Both are available in the HuggingFace model hub:
- [Flair BiLSTM model](https://huggingface.co/lirondos/anglicisms-spanish-flair-cs), fed with [codeswitch embeddings](https://huggingface.co/sagorsarker/codeswitch-spaeng-lid-lince) and subword embeddings, based on [Flair library](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) (F1=85.76)
- [multilingual BERT model fine-tuned for the task of detecting anglicisms](https://huggingface.co/lirondos/anglicisms-spanish-mbert), based on [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/) (F1=83.55)
